Dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice by using the GIPHY API. Using Javascript &amp; jQuery the HTML will change. 

The page comes populated with some of my personal favorites. You can add new movies to the list and generate gif images. Click on them to see the gif in action. Click on the favorite buttons to add them to your favorites list on the right hand side of the page. 

Download button does not work in this version.
